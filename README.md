It's easy...

1. [Create an issue](https://github.com/foss2serve/collaborium/issues/new)
2. In it, answer...
    * __Where__ does the artifact live (URL)?
    * __What__ is the artifact (a brief description)?
    * __Why__ is it useful to you?
3. Add label(s) (using the Label pulldown)
4. Stick around and comment on [previously added issues](https://github.com/foss2serve/collaborium/issues)
